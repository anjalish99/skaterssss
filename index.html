      Doesn't matter if they're rolling up to a crusty little local park for a session or a demo, or if they're hitting
      every cutty little street spot imaginable. This crew shows up, kills it and has an infectious ability to make us
      envy the amount fun they're having every step of the way.Tattoos in the hotel room, big group dinners, sleeping
      where and when you can—skateboarders live a helluva life and that lifestyle is a major part of what keeps us
      hooked. Memories like this aren't experienced if you're living a safe, average life. These moments are reserved
      for people like this. The ones living with intention, on a whim, ready to rip at any moment for no other reason
      besides the natural urge to simply do so. Get it strait!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Jersey barriers are notoriously difficult to skate, yet extremely satisfying to get any type of trick on. But
        this switch nosegrind (Jerry grind, ode to Hsu) clip from Ian McGraw is pretty insane.

        More often than not, we see a little DIY support on barrier spots; maybe some added transition, or just general
        TLC to ease it up a bit. But Ian took it upon himself to bash into the thing -- switch, no less -- and get on
        top of it!</li>
      <li>After digging through a few other videos on Ian's IG, I noticed he's no stranger to this barrier spot, nor
        challenging spots in general. His feed is a mixture of crusty spots and rad art, a small glimpse into his
        creative mind.</li>
      <li>If you've ever skated a spot like this, then you know just how gnarly this trick is. The process of the make
        is exciting to watch as well, and might have you at the edge of your chair waiting for that glorious roll away.
        And if you're looking at this wondering, What's the big deal? Then I challenge you to stop and step to one the
        next time the moment presents itself. Humble yourself and get yours!</li>
